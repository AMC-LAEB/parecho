# Supplementary files for Parker et al. (2020)

Phylogenetic trees and genbank accessions of reference Parechovirus A sequences used in our paper are deposited here alongside phyloplace.py, a wrapper script that was used to phylogenetically place new query sequences to a reference phylogeny that was previously clustered by PhyCLIP for genotype assignment.
